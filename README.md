# Overview 
A variety of bioinformatics tools and methods were used to conduct an exploratory analysis of the TDP-43 protein and its role in the neurodegenerative disorder ALS.
<br/><br/>
An initial literature review identified a hypothesis that prion-like regions in TDP-43 could become cleaved and
cause misfolding of wild type TDP-43 resulting in loss of protein function and genomic instability of neuron
cells.
<br/><br/>
The theory that a loss of TDP-43 function could result in ALS symptoms is supported by the SNP meta analysis
of rs367543041 whereby mutant TDP-43 expressed in ALS patients was found to be relatively unstable.
<br/><br/>
The theory that the TDP-43 protein contains a prion-like region was confirmed by analysis of the proteinâ€™s
secondary structure. Further, through multiple sequence alignment it was identified that this low complexity
prion-like region is conserved at the secondary structure level, despite being unconserved in primary structure.
This suggests that the prion-like nature of this region is important for TDP-43 function.
<br/><br/>
Taken together, these analyses support the theory that cleavage of TDP-43 is a crucial causative factor in the
formation of neural membrane protein aggregates and the development of ALS.
